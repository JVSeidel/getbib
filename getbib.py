#This script is a quick-hand way to query the ads system for
#bibtex references.
#It is called from the command line outside of python as:
#python3 getbib.py [authorname] [optional: startyear] [optional: endyear] [optional: path to bibfile (bib.bib by default)]
#Examples:
#python3 getbib.py Hoeijmakers'
#python3 getbib.py Hoeijmakers 2012'
#python3 getbib.py Hoeijmakers 2012 ~/Documents/paper/references.bib'
#python3 getbib.py Hoeijmakers 2012 2019 ~/Documents/paper/references.bib'
#python3 getbib.py Hoeijmakers ~/Documents/paper/references.bib'
#These examples will query the ads for all references with Hoeijmakers as first author,
#with or without a selection of the time frame between the years 2012 and 2019.

#Note that the first numeral is always assumed to be the start year.
#Providing only the endyear is not possible.

#The script understands initials in a similar way as the ADS query system does, as follows:
#python3 getbib.py Hoeijmakers,H.J. 2003 2031 ~/Documents/paper/references.bib

#The script will return all the references found, and allow the user to select one
#or multiple references (separated by comma's), which are to be added to the specified
#(or default) bib file.
#The script will then query ads for the bibtex reference text, and parse it into the
#bibfile, while changing the name to [surname][year] (e.g. Hoeijmakers2018).
#If a bibfile with the specified name already exists, the program checks whether
#a bibtex reference it is trying to add is already in the bib file. In that case,
#it will append a lower-case letter to the name of the reference, stating with b.
#e.g. Hoeijmakers2018 would become Hoeijmakers2018b.

#If this way of returning references is every altered by ADS, this code will probably fail
#to parse the html table (see below) properly.
#==================================================================



#First we check the input for completeness and extract the right strings:
surname,startyear,endyear,outbib = ut.parse_input(sys.argv)
#Then we start constructing the URL needed to access ADS.
url = ut.create_ads_url(surname,startyear,endyear)
# root = 'http://adsabs.net/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?db_key=AST&aut_logic=OR&'
# author = 'author=%5E'+surname
# start = '&start_mon=&start_year='+str(startyear)
# end = '&end_mon=&end_year='+str(endyear)
# tail = '&ttl_logic=OR&title=&txt_logic=OR&text=&nr_to_return=2000&start_nr=1&sort=NDATE&jou_pick=ALL'
